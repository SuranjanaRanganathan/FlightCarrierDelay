Variable correlation:

Let’s take the following hypothesis: The later in the day, the more likely it is that a flight will be delayed. Is there any relationship between arrival time and delay time of a flight?

A simple way of proving this hypothesis is through a simple query that extracts and creates groupings by arrival time, measuring the average delay time in each of the time intervals.

   avg(ArrDelayMinutes)
from
   my_table
group by
   substr(DepTime, 0, 2)
order by
   foo asc;

Indeed, the later in the day, the more delays there are, because flight delays are usually accumulative. Because flights that arrive late in the night still arrive after midnight, the early hours of the day are the ones that accumulate the most delay time.
Creating visualizations and graphs

Other questions that could be asked the same way and at the same cost: What days in the week accumulated the majority of delayed flights? Which flights are delayed the most, by company?


ToDO

    delays by year
    delay by month or week
    delay on hourly basis of a day
    busiest airports
    top cities
    When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
    Do older planes suffer more delays?
    How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
    How well does weather predict plane delays?
    Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
