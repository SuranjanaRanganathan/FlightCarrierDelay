# FlightCarrierDelay
Flight delays are a major problem in the Air Travel industry, and are treated as
one of the most remembered performance indicators of an airline. There are several inevitable conditions such that cause flight delays: bad
weather, air trafficking or any unforeseen events.
Our goals are as follows:
1)Best airlines to avoid delays.
2)Severely delayed airports.
3)Best months to fly in order to avoid delays.
4)Airlines with the most flight cancellations.
